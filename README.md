This project utilizes an ESP32 development board to emulate a device used for medical appplications. The device will allow the user to press a button to administer medication to a patient emitting a light out of a red LED.
Another button can be pressed remotely via a website which will alert hopsital staff to tend to the patient, the button flashes a constant flashing red LED until it is pressed again. A green LED will flash
representing the patients heartbeat, the rate of the heartbeat can be changed via a potentiometer, if the heart rate reaches a pace that is too high, the board will pick up on it and alert the user of the issue.
